<p>I run Ally Skills Workshops for groups of people interested in learning how to combat sexism and transphobia. My workshops are based off the Ada Initiative's model and incorporate some of its CC licensed materials, as well as additional materials that I have developed.

<b> What's an ally? And what's this workshop? </b><br>

An ally is someone who stands up in support of members of another social identity group; typically a member of a dominant group standing beside member(s) of a group being discriminated against or treated unjustly. <p>

The Ally Skills workshop is a 2.5 hour interactive session for people to work on developing those skills in a safe and comfortable learning environment with an experienced facilitator. <p>

This workshop specifically focuses on helping people recognize sexist or transphobic patterns, develop language to call out casual sexism and transphobia, and respond to uncomfortable situations. If you've ever come away from a conversation with someone who said something casually misogynistic and wished that you had known how to respond, this is for you. <p>

<b> What kinds of group is this workshop appropriate for? </b> <br>
All kinds of groups, so long as the members want to learn how to be better allies! I'm particularly comfortable running it for groups of people in academica or in technology, but certainly happy to chat about whether we can find a way to make it work for your organization.

<b> Will you come run it for my group? </b> <br>
Possibly! Contact me (kendra dot serra at gmail dot com) and we can talk about what you're looking for, rates, and timing. If you'd like to talk to someone at an organization where I've ran a workshop to hear about a participant viewpoint, let me know and I'll connect you.

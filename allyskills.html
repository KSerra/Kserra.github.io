<p>I run Ally Skills Workshops for groups of people interested in learning how to step up and use their societal advnatages to help marginalized people. My workshops are based off the Ada Initiative's model and incorporate some of its CC licensed materials, as well as materials by Val Aurora and additional materials that I have developed. I currently have two different versions - one aimed specifically at sexism and transphobia, and another that aims at teaching broader post-election ally skills, including bystander intervention and how to have discussions with defensive people.

<p>A current set of slides for the anti-sexism and transphobia workshop is available here (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5027557/Kendra%20Ally%20Skills%20Presentation%2010-1.ppt">ppt</a>) or here (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5027557/Kendra%20Ally%20Skills%20Presentation%2010-1.pdf">pdf</a>).<p>

A current set of slides for the post-election workshop is available here (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5027557/Post-Election%20Ally%20Skills%20Workshop.pptx">pptx</a>) or here (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5027557/Post-Election%20Ally%20Skills%20Workshop%20PDF.pdf">pdf</a>). A handout with key takeaways and resources is here (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5027557/Cheat%20Sheet%20PDF.pdf">pdf</a>) <p>

<b> What's an ally? And what's this workshop? </b><br>

An ally is someone who stands up in support of members of another social identity group; typically a member of a dominant group standing beside member(s) of a group being discriminated against or treated unjustly. The Ally Skills workshop is a 2.5-3 hour interactive session for people to work on developing their ally skills in a safe and comfortable learning environment. <p>

The post-election ally skills workshop teaches three
different intervention styles with different goals. Participants
practice basic ally responses, which aim primarily to set norms
about acceptable behavior; bystander intervention strategies, which
aim to intervene to assist targets of harassment directly; and
strategies for talking to defensive people about hard
topics, which aim to change minds. <p>

The anti-sexism and transphobia workshop specifically focuses on helping people recognize problematic patterns, develop language to call out casual sexism and transphobia, and respond to uncomfortable situations. If you've ever come away from a conversation with someone who said something casually misogynistic and wished that you had known how to respond, this is for you. <p>

<b>Here's what some participants have said about their experiences at my workshops: </b><p>

<div style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>
"My ally workshop experience with Kendra was like a firmware update for my hippocampus. I will feel much easier connecting with folks outside my familiar network now."

"Overall I think this was the most welcoming and engaging workshop i have ever attended. Kendra made it easy to connect with nearly everyone in the whole group (30 or so people) but breaking into groups and letting everyone be heard. I was so impressed by the way they organized and facilitated the evening. It's also challenging and often uncomfortable subject matter so it was even more impressive that everyone felt comfortable enough to open up, listen to one another and share ideas. I personally learned a lot and Kendra tailored the workshop perfectly to empower everyone in our organization to better handle uncomfortable situations like ones that involved sexist and transphobic behavior. I hope we can have them back again!"

Â "A friendly, open atmosphere to discuss and think about complex issues. Often in real life situations, it's hard to know exactly how one should react to certain objectionable behaviors, and discussing good responses in a controlled risk-free setting helps to ensure our success out in the real world."

<b> What kinds of group is this workshop appropriate for? </b> <br><p>
All kinds of groups, so long as the members want to learn how to be better allies! I'm particularly comfortable running it for groups of people in academia or in technology, but certainly happy to chat about whether we can find a way to make it work for your organization. I've run versions at academic centers, at community organizations, and for the public, to name some groups. <p>

<b> Will you come run it for my group? </b> <br><p>
Quite possibly! Contact me (kendra dot serra at gmail dot com) and we can talk about what you're looking for, rates, and timing. For organizations that are interested in running the workshop for their members, I usually customize the scenarios, so don't be surprised if your workshop looks different than the ones linked above.

If you'd like to talk to someone at an organization where I've ran a workshop to hear about a participant viewpoint, let me know and I'll connect you.

<p>Hey there! I&rsquo;m Kendra, a technology lawyer and a scholar of computing, gender, and society. </p>

<p> By day, I'm a clinical instructor at the Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard Law School, where I teach students to practice technology law. I will work on pretty much anything technology-related, but some recent highlights include:
<ul>
  <li>Drafting and submitting an <a href="https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/2020/04/27/scotus-rules-no-copyright-in-official-annotated-state-code/">amicus brief</a> on behalf of the <a href="https://case.law/">Caselaw Access Project</a> in Public.Resource.Org v. Georgia, before the Supreme Court.</li>
  <li>Developing a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3663898">comprehensive guide to FOSTA-SESTA</a> on behalf of sex worker collective Hacking // Hustling.</li>
  <li>Securing a <a href="https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/2018/10/26/a-victory-for-software-preservation-dmca-exemption-granted-for-spn/">temporary exemption to Section 1201 for software preservationists </a> on behalf of SPN, and producing a <a href="https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/a-preservationists-guide-to-the-dmca-exemption-for-software-preservation/">guide to how to use it.</a></li>
  <li>Providing legal counsel to <a href="https://meedan.com/">Meedan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/votingvillagedc?lang=en">Voting Village</a>, <a href="https://citizensandtech.org/">Citizens and Technology Lab</a> and many other amazing organizations and people.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>I also hold an appointment as a lecturer on Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality at Harvard University, where I teach a class on transgender rights and the law. In 2019, I founded the Initiative for a Representative First Amendment (IfRFA), which provides funding and support for law students from backgrounds tradtionally underrepresented in First Amendment law. I currently serve as IfRFA's director. In 2018 and 2019, I was a Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School, where I taught Advanced Constitutional Law.</p>

<p> When I'm not working and teaching, I like to make the world suck less and redistribute money. I have a side business facilitating <a href="http://kendraalbert.com/allyskills.html">workshops to help people practice ally skills</a>. Other than that, I spend my free time reading, playing video games, cooking, and finding new ways to organize my life. </p>


<p> I tweet at <a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra">@KendraSerra</a>. I occasionally blog about things I've been thinking about. Reach me by email at kendra dot serra at gmail dot com. My pronouns are <a href="./Gender.html">they/theirs</a>. For more info on my background and accomplishments, feel free to peruse my <a href="https://Kserra.github.io/KendraCV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>

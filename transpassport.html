<p>After the election of Donald Trump, I started running a matching program for trans people who need to update their names and/or gender markers on their documentation, specifically passports. Between November 2016 and March 2017, we matched donors and folks in need for more than $95,000. <p>

We focused on passports because getting an updated passport is currently the <a href="<http://www.themarysue.com/trans-in-america-2016"> easiest way to get a government id that matches your name and gender marker.</a> Under the Obama administration, you can get a passport with an updated gender marker by submitting a letter from your doctor. Passport policy is under the president's control, so this could <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/translawhelp-transgender-documentation-trump-4c75dd25b8a9#.2ck3gd1ze"> change at any time</a>. So helping people get accurate documentation is vital.<p>

Over the course of the three months, we were able to help many trans people update their documentation. If you're curious about the thought process behind the project or why I ended it, I talk a bit about that on a podcast episode with Diana Kimball and Lisa Sanchez called <a href="http://www.shouldwe.co/season-03/give-away">"Should We Give Away Other People's Money?"</a><p>

Although I'm no longer running this project, there are still other projects helping trans people that could use financial support. You can give to the <a href="https://www.transassistance.org/">Trans Assistance Project</a>, <a href="https://www.translifeline.org/"> Trans Lifeline</a>/ or the <a href="https://srlp.org/"> Sylvia Rivera Law Project. </a><p>
